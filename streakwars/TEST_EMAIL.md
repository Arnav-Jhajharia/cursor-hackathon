# Email Testing Guide

## Current Status
âœ… **Email system is working!** But with Resend limitations for free accounts.

## How to Test

### 1. Test with Your Own Email
- Go to Friends â†’ Add Friend
- Enter your own email: `jhajhariaarnav@gmail.com`
- Click Send
- **You should receive the email!** âœ…

### 2. Test with Other Emails
- Try any other email address
- You'll see: "Invitation created! (Email sending is in test mode)"
- **This is expected** - Resend free tier only allows emails to your own address

## What's Working
âœ… **Invitation system** - Creates database records
âœ… **Email template** - Beautiful HTML design
âœ… **Email delivery** - Works to your own email
âœ… **Error handling** - Graceful fallback for testing

## For Production
To send emails to anyone:
1. **Verify a domain** at resend.com/domains
2. **Update the `from` address** in `convex/email.ts`
3. **Remove test mode limitations**

## Test It Now!
Try sending an invitation to `jhajhariaarnav@gmail.com` - you should receive a beautiful email! ðŸŽ‰

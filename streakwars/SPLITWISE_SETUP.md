# Splitwise Integration Setup

## Overview
The Splitwise integration allows users to create money-based challenges where winners are automatically settled via Splitwise API.

## Features
- **Money Challenges**: Create challenges with real money prizes
- **Automatic Settlement**: Winners are automatically paid via Splitwise
- **Multi-currency Support**: USD, EUR, GBP, CAD
- **Group Management**: Automatic Splitwise group creation for challenges

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Splitwise API Key
1. Go to [Splitwise Developers](https://secure.splitwise.com/oauth_clients)
2. Create a new OAuth application
3. Get your API key

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
# Splitwise API Configuration

## How It Works

### Creating Money Challenges

3. System creates Splitwise group for participants
4. Prize pool is tracked in database

### Challenge Settlement
1. When challenge ends, winner is determined
2. System creates Splitwise expense
3. Winner receives full prize amount
4. Other participants owe their share
5. Settlement is tracked in database
